# Hand-Digit-Recognition

Developed a hand digit recognition system using machine learning techniques to classify handwritten digits from images. This project involved building and training a model to accurately recognize and predict digits from handwritten samples.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilized the MNIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of handwritten digits, to train and test the model.
Model Architecture: Implemented and fine-tuned a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification to achieve high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.
Training and Evaluation: Employed techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and regularization to improve model performance and generalization.
Deployment: Created a user-friendly interface for real-time digit recognition and prediction, integrating the model into an application or web service.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, MNIST Dataset.
